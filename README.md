# Trip-planner

C++ trip planner program that offers users various travel services, including transport options and accommodation choices. The program showcases key object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, operator overloading, function overloading, friend functions, file reading, and encapsulation. It aims to assist users in planning and organizing their travel itineraries with ease and flexibility.

The program incorporates three essential classes: "transport," "accommodation," and "Itinerary." The "transport" class allows users to choose from four transportation modes and destinations, each associated with specific prices. Similarly, the "accommodation" class enables users to select accommodation types and destinations, each offering distinct prices and hotel recommendations.

The "Itinerary" class inherits functionalities from both "transport" and "accommodation" classes, facilitating the creation of personalized trip plans. Users can select their desired destination, transportation mode, accommodation type, and the number of nights they plan to stay. The program then calculates the estimated total price for the selected services.

Additionally, the program includes a "customer_info" class that collects user information, such as name, age, and phone number, for billing details and a more personalized experience.

The implementation of operator overloading and friend functions enables seamless integration and calculation of prices for transportation and accommodation services, providing a comprehensive overview of the user's total expenses.

Moreover, the program includes a file reading function that loads and displays an ASCII art image as an aesthetic element for the user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.

In conclusion, the presented C++ trip planner program demonstrates the effective utilization of object-oriented programming concepts to create a versatile and user-friendly platform for travelers. With its robust features and intuitive design, the program empowers users to plan and optimize their travel arrangements effortlessly.
